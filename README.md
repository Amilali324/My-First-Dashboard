# My-First-Dashboard
Iâ€™ve just created and published my first Power BI dashboard â€“ SN Corp Dashboard! ðŸŽ‰

This project helped me dive deeper into data visualization and transform raw data into clear, actionable insights.

Key Highlights of the Dashboard:

ðŸ’° KPIs at a glance â€“ Sales (1.3M), Cost (640.6K), Profit (627K)

ðŸ—º Business by countries served â€“ Geographic distribution of customers

ðŸ“ˆ Orders trend by quarter & year â€“ Tracking growth patterns over time

ðŸ“¦ Quantity sold by region â€“ Central, North, and South performance breakdown

ðŸª‘ Top sub-categories â€“ From Bookcases to Labels

ðŸ“ƒ Customer-wise performance â€“ Individual sales, cost, and profit details
